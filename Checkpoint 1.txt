What is activation function? 

The activation function is the most important factor in a neural network which decided whether or not a neuron will be activated or not and transferred to the next layer. This simply means that it will decide whether the neuronâ€™s input to the network is relevant or not in the process of prediction

Activation functions help in normalizing the output between 0 to 1 or -1 to 1. It helps in the process of backpropagation due to their differentiable property

During backpropagation, loss function gets updated, and activation function helps the gradient descent curves to achieve their local minima.
